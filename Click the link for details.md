I take over the task from the manager.Then, I create a Business Request & User Stories to identify the problem and have a specific direction.
I use SQL (Data Cleansing & Transformation) and Excel to create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories
From the data I processed in SSMS using SQL. I use Power BI to create a dashboard. From there, I can observe the Sales Overview, Product & Customer Detail through many different dimensions.
